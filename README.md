Note: I was missing quite a lot of information. I now know exactly what to write down an dhow specific I should be. For the plats I also added a lot more information that would have been answered in the player section. single brackets are what I added based on class discussion and double brackets are what I wrote but crossed out as it did not fit the class discussion.


## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


Write your Devlog here!
